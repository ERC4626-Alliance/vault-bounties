# Velodrome ERC7575 Vault Wrapper 

## Summary
This repo contains [ERC7575](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7575) vault wrapper contracts for Velodrome V2 liquidity pools (stable and volatile) to enable multi-asset deposits and withdrawals. It is an extension of ERC4626 Vault standard to support multiple assets or entry points for the same share token. This also enables Vaults which donâ€™t have a true share token but rather convert between two arbitrary external tokens.

> This is a submission for [4626 Alliance Hackathon Competition!](https://x.com/erc4626/status/1808141681805422754) ðŸŽ‰

**Key features:**
- Factory contract ([VelodromeERC7575VaultFactory.sol](../velodrome-7575-wrapper/src/VelodromeERC7575VaultFactory.sol)) to easily deploy the share token and vault contracts for any Velodrome pool.
- [Share token (ERC20) contract](../velodrome-7575-wrapper/src/VelodromeERC7575Share.sol) for the V2 Pools. 
- Two [vault contracts](../velodrome-7575-wrapper/src/VelodromeERC7575Vault.sol) per pool - one for `token0` and one for `token1`
- Handles all the swapping and liquidity provision logic internally in the vault contracts.
- Supports both stable and volatile pools.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The wrapper implementation should work for basic [Aerodrome](aerodrome.finance) pools as well as both follow the same implementation (fork).


## Features Achieved
- [x] ERC7575-compliant wrapper contracts for Velodrome/Aerodrome pools
- [x] Factory contract for easy deployment of wrapper and share contracts.
- [x] Support for both stable and volatile pool types.
- [x] Fork tests.
- [x] Deployment and vault creation scripts.

> [!TIP]
> Volatile pools use `x.y=K` curve <br/>
> Stable pools use `x^3.y + y^3.x=K` curve


## Testing and deployment:
- **Install dependencies:**
```sh
forge install
```

- **To run all the tests**:
```sh
forge test
```

- **To deploy the Factory**:
```sh
forge script ./scripts/DeployVelodromeERC7575VaultFactory.s.sol --rpc-url <RPC_URL> --broadcast

# Output:
# ...
# VelodromeERC7575VaultFactory deployed at: <FACTORY_ADDRESS>
# ...
```

Once the factory contract is deployed, you can create new WrapperVaults for the pools via the `CreateVault` [script](./scripts/CreateVault.s.sol):
- Update the factory contract address in the script.
- Replace the `token0`, `token1` and `poolAddress` fields in the script.
- Run:
```sh
forge script ./scripts/CreateVault.s.sol --rpc-url <RPC_URL> --broadcast
```
- The address of vault and share contracts will be printed.

## Architecture

![](./assets/7575wrapper-arch.png)

**1. Share Token Contract**
 - ERC20 token representing ownership of liquidity in the pool.
 - Minted to users upon deposit and burned during withdrawals.
 - Separate share token deployed for each pool.

**2. Vault Contracts (x2)**
 - Implements ERC4626 methods and events excluding ERC20 methods and events. 
 - Deployed for each of the two tokens in the pool (`token0` and `token1`)  
 - Handle deposits by swapping half the assets to the other token and adding liquidity.
 - Enable withdrawals by removing liquidity and swapping assets back to the original token
 - Mint and burn share tokens during deposits and withdrawals.

**3. Factory Contract**
 - Facilitates deployment of share token and vault contracts
 - Called with the addresses of the two tokens and the pool to deploy wrappers for
 - Returns the addresses of the newly deployed share token and vault contracts

**Usage**:
1. Deploy the factory contract.
2. Call the `createVault()` method to deploy wrappers for each desired pool.
3. Direct user deposits and withdrawals to the vault contracts based on the `asset`.

## Pain Points
- No/very minimal reference implementation. 
- Handling both stable and volatile pools required additional logic and checks.
- Finding the optimal split of assets to swap before adding liquidity was tricky to implement.
- Dust issue when swapping/depositing to pools.

## Future improvement ideas:
- More robust methods to calculate amounts to add liquidity.
- Make current implementation is resistant to pool manipulation attacks.
- Extend support for Concentrated pools (Slipstream).
- More tests.
