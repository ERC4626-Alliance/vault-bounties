# Tokenized Vault Competition @ ETHCC
## Project: Vault Graph

The README MUST contain the following minimum content:
- `Unique subbmission name`. We will use this submission name to identify your project, award it with prizes and call you for presentation.
- `Summary` of the project and explanation of what was achieved in bullet points
- `Presentation` a video link (or embedded in markdown) of your presentation. Rules and guidelines in `How to make a video presentation` section below. If you are going to present in person you **DO NOT** need to provide a video link (can indicate 'In person' in this field)
- `Feature achieved` Visual slide / image / diagram that accompanies the summary of the project showcasing the achieved feature
- `Architecture` section which explains the nature of the wrapping procedure. Example, for asynchronous wrapped vaults, this should outline the expected changes for the protocol in question (e.g Lido) to adopt and operate the wrapped code.
- `Pain points` section where it is described what couldn't be achieved and what was hard to do.
- `Libraries` used
- `EVM address for prize submission`. An address at your descretion must be provided to receive prizes.
- `Contact` information, which must contain your **twitter handle which you used to register to the lu.ma event**. This is important so we can link submissions in this repository to actual presenters in the in-person meeting. 

Any submissions past the deadline which don't contain the minimum content above will be disqualified from presenting and from receiving any top prizes (but may still earn a participation prize).

## How to submit code
Create a folder with your project name. E.g "my-fancy-wrapped-ethena-7540" within a fork of the `vault-bounties` repo. 

When you want to commit code, just open a pull request to the `vault-bounties` repo.

**We care about original submissions, therefore any repositories with single commits of the entire work at the end of the deadline will be entirely disqualified as that may be regarded as a port of an existing project (see Event Rules section)** 

**You must use proper source control by commiting often and showing the history of your work through the week!**

All considered valid pull requests will be merged with the `vault-bounties` post submission deadline.

## How to make a video presentation

Any contestant who doesn't want to present live or can't make it to the event in person can present by recording a video presentation.

This presentation has the following requirements:
- Video publicly available (embedded in the markdown/available on youtube are good ideas)
- Minimum of 1 minute and a maximum of 3 minutes per presentation!
- Must share your whole screen
- Should have your voice walking us through the presentation (i.e it must not be a silent presentation)
- Minimum 720p resolution, but ideally 1080p+

To do a presentation in a good quality, you recommend to use Loom, Zoom screenshare or QuickTime player if you use your Mac

Please keep introductions in your video brief and make sure your environment is ready (tabs, windows, content you are going to present) before starting to record.
